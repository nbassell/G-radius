# Plaque Attack!

[Live Demo][github]

## Background
Released in 1985 by Konami, Gradius was one of the first side-scrolling shoot-'em-up arcade games. The player maneuvers a spacecraft around enemies and obstacles, shooting them to obtain points. My version, Plaque Attack, will be a circle-themed version of this game, also loosely based on a minigame within Cuphead, a run and gun indie game released in 2017. In this minigame, players control an airplane and shoot gaps in columns in order to continue along the side-scrolling path of the level.



## Technologies and Libraries
For this project, I created my own images and used no external libraries. I used solely JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas and CSS.

## Playing the Game
Players use the `arrow keys` to move Drix around the screen. Floor-to-ceiling columns appear on the right-hand side, each with a segment that can destroyed by the player. Players shoot using `space`. Blowing up a column segment leaves a gap for the player to pass through.

## Future Features
* Add high scores
* Increase difficulty gradually with time played
* Allow players to turn into a bomb to 1-shot targets
