## Background
Released in 1985 by Konami, Gradius was one of the first side-scrolling shoot-'em-up arcade games. The player maneuvers a spacecraft around enemies and obstacles, shooting them to obtain points. Plaque Attack is an anatomy-themed version of this game. Players control Drix (from Osmosis Jones) and shoot Good Cholesterol at plaque buildup that blocks their way forward.

## Technologies and Libraries
For this project, I created my own images and used no external libraries, solely
* JavaScript
* HTML5 Canvas
* CSS

## Playing the Game
Players use the `arrow keys` to move Drix around the screen. Floor-to-ceiling columns appear on the right-hand side, each with a segment that can destroyed by the player. Players shoot using `space`. Blowing up a column segment leaves a gap for the player to pass through.

## Future Features
* Add high scores
* Increase difficulty gradually with time played
* Allow players to turn into a bomb to 1-shot targets
